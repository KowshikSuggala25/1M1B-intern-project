# Project Title: 1M1B Individual Carbon Reduction Challenge

## 💡 Idea and Project Description

The **1M1B Individual Carbon Reduction Challenge** is a project aimed at empowering individuals to take measurable action in reducing their carbon footprint. This initiative addresses the common challenge of wanting to live more sustainably but lacking the tools to quantify the impact of daily actions. Through this project, participants will track their habits and witness the real-world CO₂ savings they generate, both individually and collectively.


## 📋 Problem Statement

Interns often contribute to carbon emissions through their daily activities, such as transportation, dietary choices, and energy consumption. Despite a growing desire to reduce their environmental impact, they frequently lack a structured and measurable way to see the tangible results of their efforts during the internship period.


## 🛠️ Solution

The core of this project is a **structured, data-driven approach to sustainable living**. Each participant selects and commits to 3-5 sustainable habits (e.g., cycling instead of driving, reducing single-use plastic, choosing a plant-based meal, or switching off unused electronic devices). These actions are logged daily in a shared digital tracker. Each habit is mapped to a standard CO₂ saving value, allowing for the calculation of total individual and collective carbon reduction. The results are then visualized and shared via a dashboard or report, providing a clear and impactful summary of the collective effort.


## 🌿 Green Skills & 💻 Tech Skills

  * **Green Skills**: Low-carbon lifestyle design, sustainable consumption practices, and collective climate action.
  * **Tech Skills**: Utilization of shared digital trackers, data entry, and data visualization using tools such as Excel, Google Sheets, or Tableau.


## 🏗️ Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

  * **Tool Setup**: Provide interns with a ready-to-use digital tracker (e.g., Google Sheets).
  * **Habit Selection**: Each participant chooses 3-5 personal sustainable habits to track.
  * **Daily Logging**: Interns consistently record their actions throughout the internship.
  * **Impact Mapping**: Logged habits are converted into measurable CO₂ savings using predefined values.
  * **Analysis**: Individual and collective carbon reductions are calculated and compared.
  * **Presentation**: Results are compiled and presented in a collective dashboard, report, or closing presentation.


## 📊 Impact Metrics

  * **Total CO₂ Saved**: The cumulative amount of carbon dioxide (in kg or MT) saved by all interns during the project period.
  * **Average Savings per Intern**: The average CO₂ reduction achieved by each participant.
  * **Sustainable Actions Adopted**: The total number of sustainable actions tracked throughout the challenge.


## 📈 Deep Impact Possibility

This challenge has the potential to become a **recurring activity** for future internship cohorts, generating a cumulative CO₂ savings report over time. It can also be scaled as a gamified sustainability initiative for schools, universities, or corporations, contributing to their ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and citizen science reporting efforts.
